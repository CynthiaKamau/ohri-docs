# Sections

A section is an element of a form schema that groups together related questions. Sections will be rendered in "expanded mode" by default. Set `isExpanded` to `false` in the section definition if you want section rendered in "collapsed mode".

Below is an example of a basic section:

```json copy
{
  "label": "Testing history",
  "isExpanded": true,
  "questions": [
    {
      "label": "What was the result of the last HIV test?",
      "type": "obs",
      "questionOptions": {
        "rendering": "select",
        "concept": "159427AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
        "answers": [
          {
            "concept": "6378487b-584d-4422-a6a6-56c8830873ff",
            "label": "Positive"
          },
          {
            "concept": "664AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
            "label": "Negative"
          },
          {
            "concept": "7398c91a-8db8-480d-8130-1a92cc208ded",
            "label": "Inconclusive"
          },
          {
            "concept": "1067AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
            "label": "Unknown"
          }
        ]
      },
      "id": "lastHIVTestResult"
    }
  ]
}
```
